## Good to go

_the app currently installs as `checklists-ts` and a `CheckMate` splash. I couldn't come up with a name for a while and will consolidate it shortly. Cheers_

### An app for ticking off recurring checklists with the same set of tasks.

Use it for any consistent set of tasks, from packing for your quarterly office meetups, to making sure you haven't forgotten to add salt this time.

### Bugs?

This project was tossed together over a couple evenings and you can clearly see that in the quality of the code. 

(That, and I couldn't be bothered to figure out why the early material you library refused to work nicely with navigation)

There are likely bugs or unexpected behaviours - if you find any please raise an issue ☝️
